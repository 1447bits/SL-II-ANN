## Artificial Neural Network LAB

1. Write a Python program to plot a few activation functions that are being used in neural networks. 

1. Generate ANDNOT function using McCulloch-Pitts neural net by a python program

1. Write a Python Program using Perceptron Neural Network to recognize even and odd numbers. Given numbers are in ASCII form 0 to 9

1. With a suitable example demonstrate the perceptron learning law with its decision regions using python. Give the output in graphical form.

1. Write a python program to recognize the numbers 0, 1, 2, 39. A 5 * 3 matrix forms the numbers. For any valid point it is taken as 1 and invalid point it is taken as 0. The net has to be trained to recognize all the numbers and when the test data is given, the network has to recognize the particular numbers

1. Implement Artificial Neural Network training process in Python by using Forward Propagation, Back Propagation.

1. Write a python program to show Back Propagation Network for the XOR function with Binary Input and Output

1. Write a python program to illustrate ART neural network.

1. Write a python program to design a Hopfield Network which stores 4 vectors

1. Write Python program to implement CNN object detection. Discuss numerous performance evaluation metrics for evaluating the object-detecting algorithms' performance.

1.  For an image classification challenge, create and train a ConvNet in Python using TensorFlow. Also, try to improve the performance of the model by applying various hyperparameter tuning to reduce the overfitting or underfitting problems that might occur. Maintain graphs of comparisons.

1. TensorFlow/Pytorch implementation of CNN

1. MNIST Handwritten Character Detection using PyTorch, Keras and Tensorflow
